### Shark Attacks - Dataset Cleaning project

Working in data can be time-consuming, with up to 60–70% of a project being spent on data cleaning and preparation. That’s because real-life data is often messy and needs fixing before we can make sense of it. Knowing how to clean and organize data is key to getting the most out of our analysis.

One example of data that is not ready to be worked with is the Shark Attacks dataset available on Kaggle where filed have information in all "shapes and sizes" so, I decided to clean it and turn it into something from which I could extract decent conclusions about the danger of sharks. 

This project was completes entirely with Pandas.
